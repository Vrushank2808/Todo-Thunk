# Todo-Thunk

Todo-Thunk is a simple Todo application built with React and Redux Toolkit, utilizing Thunk middleware for handling asynchronous actions. This project serves as a practical example of managing side effects in a Redux application.

## Features

- **Add Todos**: Users can add new tasks to their todo list.
- **Delete Todos**: Users can remove tasks from their list.
- **Fetch Todos**: Demonstrates fetching tasks from an API using asynchronous actions with Thunk.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vrushank2808/Todo-Thunk.git
   ```


2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd Todo-Thunk
   ```


3. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```


## Usage

1. **Start the development server**:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```


   This will run the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

2. **Build for production**:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```


   This will build the app for production to the `build` folder.
